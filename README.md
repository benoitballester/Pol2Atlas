A high-resolution atlas of intergenic transcription in nearly 29,000 normal and cancer samples.

## Introduction

This project provides a high-resolution atlas of intergenic transcription in nearly 29,000 normal and cancer samples. The atlas was generated using publicly available RNA-seq data and a novel computational pipeline. The atlas can be used to identify intergenic transcripts that are associated with specific tissues or diseases, and to investigate the potential functional roles of these transcripts.
