## Background

This study present an atlas of active intergenic regions that connects genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data across normal and cancer samples. The atlas contains over 180,000 RNA Polymerase II bound intergenic regions in more than 900 samples, revealing extensive activity in non-coding regions. By applying a meta-clustering methodology, the authors identified novel per-cancer and pan-cancer intergenic transcriptional markers showing genomic and clinically relevant characteristics, demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple yet effective integration uncovering intergenic transcriptional activity in both normal and cancer tissues.
