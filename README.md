## Background

This project is based on the research paper "A high-resolution atlas of intergenic transcription in nearly 29,000 normal and cancer samples" by Pierre de Langen et al. The aim of this project is to provide a high-resolution atlas of intergenic transcription in nearly 29,000 normal and cancer samples. The project uses bioinformatics tools and techniques to analyze the data and present the results in an easy-to-use format.
