# An atlas of RNA Polymerase II bound, potentially transcribed regions
Blabla
## Integrative analysis of peak called genomic datasets
Our code is easily reusable and applicable to other similar, peak-called datasets.
See the dedicated github and Read The Doc: peakMerge and rtd.
## Using the Pol II atlas to quantify the non-coding expression in bulk RNA-seq

## Using the Pol II atlas to quantify the non-coding expression in scRNA-seq
We provide the code to generate a new sample/count matrix, and use scanpy/seurat to perform the downstream analyses.

## Replicating the results in the paper
