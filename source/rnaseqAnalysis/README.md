# Using the Pol II catalog as an atlas for read counting in RNA-seq
We use as an example the TCGA RNA-seq atlas to identify key transcribed, non coding, intergenic, regulatory elements in cancer. Count tables are available to download here:

The code and the atlas can easily be re-used for other RNA-seq datasets using the readAtlas.py module which is called in the "".py file.
