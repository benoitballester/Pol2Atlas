# Using the Pol II catalog as an atlas for read counting in scRNA-seq
We use as an example the TCGA RNA-seq atlas to identify key transcribed, non coding, intergenic, regulatory elements in cancer.

The code and the atlas can easily be re-used for other RNA-seq datasets using the readAtlas.py module, and the utilites to generate the
