# Integration and exploration of peak-called datasets.
Main analyses are in integrativeAnalysis.py and can be called using the peakMerger object or using peakMerge.py via command line.

We perform secondary, more specific plots/analyses in the other small scripts.

The pol2_preprocessing folder contains scripts specific to the preprocessing of some files for our analyses.
