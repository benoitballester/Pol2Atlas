# Integration and exploration of peak-called datasets.
Main analyses are in integrativeAnalysis.py and can be called using the peakMerger object (see code for usage example or the docstring) or using peakMerge.py via command line (see "python peakMerge.py -h" for details).

We perform secondary, more specific plots/analyses in the other small scripts.

The pol2_preprocessing folder contains scripts specific to the preprocessing of some files for our analyses.
